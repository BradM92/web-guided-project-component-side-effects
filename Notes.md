1. we will make a component that fetches Friends

2. it's a good idea to explore the API
-- try out the endpoints/URLs that the server has

3. for this server, we have learned:
-- you have to use an api key
-- and you can use the /friends endpoint
-- there's also a friends/:id endpoint

4. Let's make a component that uses this endpoint!


This is like half of React! and useEffect, useState, props, and children components are VERY RELIABLE software patterns

You can use them to build anything, and you can figure out someone else's code
